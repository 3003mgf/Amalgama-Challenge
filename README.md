# Army Modeling Simulation

Welcome to the Army Modeling simulation! This project demonstrates a core domain model for managing armies, units, training, transformations, and battles.

## How to Run

To get this simulation up and running, you'll need Node.js installed on your system.

1.  **Install Node.js:** If you don't have it, download and install the LTS version from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2.  **Save the Code:** Ensure `main.js` is saved in a convenient folder.
3.  **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the folder where `main.js` is located using `cd`.
4.  **Run the Simulation:** Simply type the following command and press Enter:

    ```bash
    node main.js
    ```

    You'll see all the simulation output directly in your terminal.

## Craft Your Own Simulation!

The `main.js` file contains the complete model. Feel free to modify the "Simulation Starts Here" section at the bottom of the `main.js` file to create your own custom scenarios! Experiment with different army compositions, training regimens, and battle sequences.

## Ready-to-Go Simulation Block

If you prefer to quickly test a different scenario without writing it from scratch, you can:

1.  Open the `main.js` file.
2.  Locate the "Copy and Paste simulation HERE :)" section (near the bottom).
4.  Open the `simulation.txt` file provided, copy its entire content, and paste it into the "Simulation Starts Here" block in `main.js`.
5.  Save `main.js` and run `node main.js` again.
